# Wirepine Lab

Wirepine Lab is an experimental, AI-native workspace exploring how the web changes when friction drops.

It’s a place to test ideas quickly, learn in public, and separate what’s real from what’s hype—without the weight of a traditional CMS or platform stack.

## What this is
- A static site built with plain HTML and CSS
- Generated and iterated with AI-assisted tooling
- Deployed via GitHub → Netlify
- Intentionally simple, fast, and easy to regenerate

## What this is not
- A product
- A framework
- An endorsement or rebuke of AI

It’s a lab.

## Philosophy
The early web was powerful because it was immediate: a folder, a page, a URL.  
AI brings some of that immediacy back.

This repo exists to explore that space—experimenting with systems, design, and AI in ways that prioritize clarity over complexity.

## Local development
No build step required.

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a simple local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
